# # Fraud Detection AI with Blockchain Integration
An open-source AI-powered fraud detection system with blockchain integration, designed to help detect financial fraud for public and governmental use in Belgium

## Overview
This project aims to develop an AI-powered fraud detection system integrated with blockchain technology. Our goal is to help detect financial fraud in the public sector, specifically in Belgium, by providing a transparent and efficient tool for monitoring and auditing financial transactions.

### Objectives
- Detect anomalies and suspicious patterns in financial transactions using AI.
- Leverage blockchain technology for transparency and immutability in transaction tracking.
- Offer a solution that can help governments and public institutions reduce fraud and improve financial accountability.

### Why This Project?
Fraud in the public sector is a significant problem, and current solutions often lack transparency and scalability. By combining AI and blockchain, we aim to provide a unique solution that doesnâ€™t currently exist in the Belgian market.

### Features
- AI models to detect fraud and anomalies in financial data.
- Blockchain-based ledger for tracking and validating every transaction.
- Open-source and community-driven approach to ensure the system remains transparent and adaptable.
