# # Fraud Detection AI with Blockchain Integration
An open-source AI-powered fraud detection system with blockchain integration, designed to help detect financial fraud for public and governmental use in Belgium

## Overview
This project aims to develop an AI-powered fraud detection system integrated with blockchain technology. Our goal is to help detect financial fraud in the public sector, specifically in Belgium, by providing a transparent and efficient tool for monitoring and auditing financial transactions.

### Objectives
- Detect anomalies and suspicious patterns in financial transactions using AI.
- Leverage blockchain technology for transparency and immutability in transaction tracking.
- Offer a solution that can help governments and public institutions reduce fraud and improve financial accountability.

### Why This Project?
Fraud in the public sector is a significant problem, and current solutions often lack transparency and scalability. By combining AI and blockchain, we aim to provide a unique solution that doesn’t currently exist in the Belgian market.

### Features
Key focus areas:
- SME Fraud: Real-time fraud detection for small and medium enterprises.
- Tax Fraud with Blockchain: Detect and prevent tax evasion with AI and blockchain.
- Cross-Border Transaction Fraud: Solutions for detecting international fraud.
- Environmental and Carbon Credit Fraud: Focus on fraudulent claims in carbon trading.
- Cryptocurrency and DeFi Fraud: Detect fraud in decentralized finance and cryptocurrency.
- Invoice Fraud in Supply Chains: Target fraudulent billing practices in complex supply chains.
- Behavioral Biometrics: Use AI to analyze user behavior and detect fraud in digital interactions.

## Getting Started
We need help with:
1. Designing AI models for fraud detection.
2. Integrating blockchain technology.
3. Creating a user-friendly interface for the tool.
4. Documentation and testing.
